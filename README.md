## Setup

Install the libraries:
```bash
$ bundle install
$ yarn install
```

Setup database:
```
$ rails db:setup
```

Build Semantic-UI Theme
```
$ cd semantic-ui-theme && gulp build
```

## Run

```
npm run serve
```

This starts the rails server plus the webpack dev server (with hot reload).
Meaning react app will get compiled automatically on save and browser will hot-reload it.
